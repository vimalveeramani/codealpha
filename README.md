Welcome to the Python Task project! This project aims to provide you with practical experience and an opportunity to showcase your Python skills for future career opportunities. We have designed a set of tasks for you to work on and gain valuable experience in different areas of Python development.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Language Translator

The objective of this task is to develop a Python project that can translate text content from one language to another in real-time with just a button click. We recommend using the tkinter library to create a graphical user interface that provides a nice user experience.

### Task 2: Currency Converter

Users will be able to select the currencies they want to convert from and to, enter the value, and click the convert button to get the desired results.

### Task 3: Pacman Game
